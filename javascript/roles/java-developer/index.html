  <h1 >JavaScript for Java developers</h1>
<p>
    You are a trustworthy Java developer. You know all tricks of the Java and you are sure that this language of blinking pages is self-evidence for you.
    <a href="/javascript/problem/drill-url-ws.html?jsonurl=/javascript/roles/java-developer/heartbreaker.json"><b>Check yourself. 3 minutes only to to solve a couple of JavaScript problems</b></a>.
    
</p>    
    
<p>
    This section of webculum.org is designed to present you the differences between Java and JavaScript only.
We intend to make maximum use of your knowledge of the Java and are not going to annoy you by repetition of the things that are the same in both languages.
