<i>“The Java- prefix suggests that JavaScript is somehow related to Java, that it is a subset or less capable version of Java. It seems that the name was intentionally selected to create confusion, and from confusion comes misunderstanding. JavaScript is not interpreted Java. Java is interpreted Java. JavaScript is a different language.”</i>

    You are a trustworthy Java developer. You know all tricks of the Java and you are sure that this language of blinking pages is self-evidence for you.

<p>
    This section of webculum.org is designed to present you the differences between Java and JavaScript only.
We intend to make maximum use of your knowledge of the Java and are not going to annoy you by repetition of the things that are the same in both languages.
