Question: is this valid JS code? Explain you answer
var x= "Hello";
x=[1,2,3];
x=5;

Tip: JavaScript is a loosely typed language
Answer: Yes
Explanation:
    
JavaScript is a loosely typed language, as opposed to strongly typed languages like Java. JavaScript variables have no predetermined type. Instead, the type of a variable is the type of its value. 
So you can assign value of any type to the variable.
e.g.
var x; // x is undefined
x = "Hello"; // x is String 
x=[1,2,3]; // x is Object 
x=5; // x is Number
