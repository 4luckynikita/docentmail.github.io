  <h2 >Webculum's short note.</h2>    
    <p>
    There is typically one global scope, and each function defined has its own (nested) local scope. Any function defined within another function has a local scope which is linked to the outer function. 
    </p>    
    <p>
        Statement <b>aVar=10;</b> (without var) creates variable in a global scope  (of course if variable was not defined before).
    </p>    
    <p>
        Block scope (grouped statements with curly braces { ... } ) created by <b>if</b>, <b>for</b>, <b>while</b>, <b>switch</b> and other statements does not define a new scope. Only <b>function</b> has it's own scope.
    </p>
