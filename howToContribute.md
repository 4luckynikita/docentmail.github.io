[Template for file of JavaScript problem](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docentmail/docentmail.github.io/master/assets/problem-2015-12-18-17-25.html_template)

How to assign correct complexity and importance for the Javascript problem? 
 Idea behind this is:

- complexity shows how hard to understand the case. 
- importance shows how importarnt to understand the case. E.g. know how it works for 1+2+"aaa" is important, but know result of typeof(typeof(123)) is not.

This problem has: 

- 5 complexity - because it is pretty ...
- 2 importance - because it is pretty rear and wierd case.

 <PRE> 
 for (i = 0, j=3; i <j ; i++,j-- ) { 
    do();
 }
 </PRE>      
<hr/>

This problem has:

- 2 complexity - because it is pretty simple to understand. No tricky tricks.
- 5 importance - because it is pretty generic case. It is just normal for loop.
